This is some kind of a naive `login` implementation
written in C#.

DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!

THIS IS JUST A SMALL SAMPLE TO SHOW THE USAGE OF THIS LIBRARY!

- Ctrl-C isn't captured
- Doesn't handle signals (e.g. `SIGTERM`, etc.)
- Running as `root` is required to make this work
- May only work on Linux
